      # IO App Design System


      ## A comprehensive library of components specifically designed for IO App


      This project is a specialized _React Native_ library for the IO App,
      providing developers with a wide range of components. 


      Users are welcome to try each component  and test them directly using the
      included example app. The system's modular design makes integration easy,
      and a storybook playground helps explore each component.


      With core attributes, foundational components, and various UI elements it
      ensures a consistent design.  


      The project is open for collaboration under the MIT license, fostering
      transparency and community engagement.
